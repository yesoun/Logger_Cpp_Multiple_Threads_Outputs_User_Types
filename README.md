Focus both on the quality of the code and to the usability of the class (API).
Send your solution to Rightware in a ZIP package containing the following contents:
o source code, solution and project files
o executable that is outputting log messages
o instructions how to compile
o list of 3 rd party dependencies, if any
o brief description of the work sample including rationale behind the implementation, as well
as its possible shortcomings and known issues
o ideas for further development

he logger needs to support multiple threads
The logger needs to be able to support multiple outputs (file, console etc.)
The logger needs to be able to support outputting user types
The logger class API needs to be documented and validated with unit test(s)
The executable code should work either on Windows (preferred), Mac OS X or Linux
