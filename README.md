# C++ Logger Class Programming Assignment

## Introdution:
The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to work with programming tasks that resemble
the day-to-day activities of the Kanzi R&D team at Rightware. This assignment focuses on C++ programming
and general middleware development practices.
Kanzi R&D lists following characteristics valuable in written code and you should keep them in mind while
working on the assignment. Both code and documentation quality will be evaluated.
- Safety 
- Modularity
- Efficiency 
- Readability & Maintainability
- Reliability & Simplicity 


## Instruction:
- Write a C++ class, which can be used to output application log messages to multiple outputs.

- Focus both on the quality of the code and to the usability of the class (API).

- Send your solution to Rightware in a ZIP package containing the following contents:
	- source code, solution and project files.
	- executable that is outputting log messages.	
	- instructions how to compile.
	- list of 3rd party dependencies, if any.	
	- brief description of the work sample including rationale behind the implementation, as well as its possible  shortcomings and known issues.
	- ideas for further development.


## Requirements
- Implementation language is C++ (with C++11 features available).
- The logger needs to support multiple threads.
- The logger needs to be able to support multiple outputs (file, console etc.).
- The logger needs to be able to support outputting user types.
- The logger class API needs to be documented and validated with unit test(s).
- The executable code should work either on Windows (preferred), Mac OS X or Linux.
